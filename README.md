# Simple Frontend Template

An example of a small and simple frontend app:

- JSX support using [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm).
- Support for modern components using [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).
- A build process that's relatively easy to understand which uses [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp).
